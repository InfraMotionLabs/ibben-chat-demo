## Who can receive personal assistance?

According to LSS (the Act on support and service to certain disabled people), it is described which people are covered by the law and divided into so-called circles of people. There are three circles of people, which are assessed based on different criteria that must be met in order for the individual to qualify for support and service.

- Circle of people 1:
  This circle of people includes people with developmental disabilities, autism or autism-like conditions from early childhood. It can also include people with acquired brain injuries that occurred before the age of 18 and that result in significant intellectual disabilities.

- Circle of people 2:
  People who, as a result of damage to the central nervous system or other severe illness, have major and lasting intellectual disabilities and thus need extensive support and services.

- Circle of people 3:
  This circle includes people with other permanent physical or mental disabilities that are so extensive that they need extensive support and services to be able to live an independent life.

It is important to note that there are certain differences in the application of these circuits between different regions and municipalities in Sweden. The exact support and service offered may vary depending on individual needs and assessments.

## What is personal assistance?

Personal assistance means that one or more personal assistants help you with your basic needs. The basic needs include washing, going to the toilet and undressing and dressing.

The personal assistance must be adapted to your unique needs and wishes. The assistance exists so that you can live your life the way you want and should therefore be adapted based on that. This can mean everything from what times your assistance takes place to whether your assistants have the necessary knowledge to be able to perform your assistance in a safe manner.

Everything is based on the right to self-determination and that you as a user should have control over your assistance.

## Basic needs

Within the legislation, the basic needs are regarded as crucial to enable the individual's personal hygiene, meals, dressing and undressing, breathing, communication and support to prevent injuries in the case of mental impairment as well as continuous support due to medical conditions. You can apply for personal assistance before you turn 66.

The needs that require assistance should be of a very personal nature, which means that they affect the integrity of the individual. In the case of personal hygiene, the assistance should be close and physically involved. In practice, the following have often been accepted: nail and skin care, tooth brushing, shaving, washing up and help with toilet visits.

Even if an individual can perform these tasks purely motorically, there may be circumstances that mean that the person cannot or should not perform them independently. Some movements that take place in close connection with the basic needs can also be accepted.

When you are granted support for more than 20 hours a week for your basic needs, other personal needs may also be taken into account. This can involve activities such as leisure activities, spending time with family and friends, work, parental responsibility, cooking, community involvement and the like. It may also include certain elements of basic needs that do not require close personal assistance.

People who can apply for personal assistance include those who have a permanent and significant disability that limits their ability to take care of their basic needs. It can include people with physical, cognitive or mental disabilities. To apply for personal assistance, you usually need to get a medical or social assessment that shows you need assistance to live an independent life.

In order for a need to be considered basic, it is required in some cases that the help is of a privacy-related nature. In many cases, this means that the help is physically close, but can also be of a personal nature, such as putting on the clothes closest to the body and going to the toilet.

### What are the basic needs?

The basic needs are stated in the LSS and are breathing, meals, personal hygiene, undressing and dressing, communication with others, preventing harm in the case of a mental disability and ongoing support in the case of a medical condition.

Here we explain the different basic needs, what they mean and what is required to get help with them.

- Breath
  In order for help with breathing to count as a basic need, there must be a documented impairment of breathing functions. It is also required that there must be a risk to the individual's health or life if assistance is not provided.

This may mean that the assistant must be available to monitor or provide support for breathing-related problems or needs, such as the use of oxygen equipment or ventilators.

- Meals
  What is meant by help with meals as a basic need is help with eating meals. Tube feeding is equated here with a meal, as it does not matter in what way the nutrition is supplied to the body. Assistance with meals covers the entire time it takes to eat a meal. Other elements do not count towards the basic need, such as preparing the food, having it served, etc.

Needing help with meals is not only limited to physical obstacles to bringing food to the mouth, but also cognitive obstacles that make the person not understand that they have to eat. Help with meals also includes chewing and swallowing and helping if the person chokes.

- Personal hygiene
  The basic need for help with personal hygiene aims to keep the body clean of dirt and other unhealthy substances. This includes washing hair, body and teeth, as well as drying oneself after washing.

- Undressing and dressing
  The basic need for undressing and dressing includes the concrete situation of putting on and taking off clothes, regardless of what time of day it happens. It may also include certain prostheses and orthopedic protection. For help with undressing and dressing to count as a basic need, the help needs to be of a sufficiently private nature. Taking off and putting on the clothes closest to the body is generally considered private and thus sensitive to personal integrity. As a rule, putting on and taking off outerwear and shoes is therefore not included in the basic need.

- Communication with others
  In order for communication with others to be counted as a basic need, another person, the personal assistant, is required to be present so that communication with others is possible. To achieve this requirement, three prerequisites must be met. The personal assistant must have knowledge of the form of communication, knowledge of the disability and special knowledge of the person with the disability.

This means that the help should not only be interpreting help, but that the assistant must also be able to interpret various expressions and reactions to stimuli, among other things.

- Prevent damage in the event of a mental disability
  In order to receive help to prevent harm in the case of a mental disability, it is required that the person in question has a mental disability. The help involves support to monitor and prevent harm that may occur as a result of behavioral or emotional challenges, including intervening in a supportive way to prevent harm to self, others or property.

- Ongoing support in the event of a medical condition
  Getting help with ongoing support for a medical condition requires that the medical condition is due to major and lasting impairments and either poses a risk to the individual's life or an imminent and serious risk to the person's physical health. It is also required that the help is needed for most of the day, i.e. more than 12 hours.

## Assistance compensation

Assistance allowance is the money that Försäkringskassan pays out in the event of decisions over 20 hours a week. If your need is less than 20 hours a week, you apply for personal assistance from your municipality instead.

It is therefore the Social Insurance Agency or the municipality that pays for your assistance and you, as an eligible person for assistance, do not pay anything yourself.

## This is how it works

- 1.Information and advice
  We at Inova provide you with information about assistance and answer your questions. We explain the various steps in the application process and what is required to get assistance granted by the municipality/Försäkringskassan.

- 2.Application form
  We help you fill in the necessary application form for assistance. We ensure that all relevant information and documents are correctly completed and attached, including medical certificates or statements from specialists.

- 3.Contact with the municipality/Frsäkringskassan
  We act as your contact with the municipality/Försäkringskassan and communicate with them on your behalf. We ensure that the application is submitted correctly and follow up with the municipality/Försäkringskassan to ensure that your application is handled efficiently.

- 4.Processing and the appeal
  If your application is rejected or if you need to appeal a decision, we assist you in the appeal process. We can help you write an appeal and represent you at any meetings or negotiations with the municipality/Frsäkringskassan.

As all people's needs are different, it is of great importance that as a personal assistant you are responsive, humble and accurate. If you also have knowledge in ergonomics, lifting technology, healthcare and sign language, it is advantageous.

The assistance hours are controlled based on the user's decision and often involve a varying weekly schedule that is shaped according to the user's needs. We at Inova Assistance have an ambition to raise the status of the professional role as we know how important your function is. Contact us if you want to work for a company that thinks innovatively and strives to create a context with a focus on development for users and assistants in their everyday life.

## What does it mean to be a personal assistant?

Primarily, personal assistance is about supporting and helping with the basic needs, which may include personal hygiene, meals, going to the toilet, communication and breathing. All users have different needs and the work tasks and working hours vary between different users depending on their decisions and needs.

The workplace is where the user is, which means that the work may have to be performed outside the user's home as well as in the home. Therefore, both work tasks and the physical workplace can vary. This may involve travel, the user's workplace, daily activities and day trips.

Anyone can become a personal assistant, but for some users different training is required to be able to perform the assistance in a safe and secure manner.

## Being a personal assistant at Inova

At Inova, we value personal chemistry between user and assistant. It is important to us so that the user is satisfied and secure with their assistance and for the assistant to enjoy their workplace. We work for the user's right to self-determination and they therefore have a part in the decision of who will be their personal assistants.

You work for your specific user and are part of a work team. The size of the work team varies based on the user's decision. Each group includes a coordinator who is himself an assistant and acts as the management's extended arm. They also act as a support for the assistants and ensure the assistance.

### Here's how to become employed at Inova:

- We always start with an interview, where the customer has the opportunity to participate.
- Before the introduction, an extract from the charge register must be sent to Inova.
- The next step is introduction to include the essential parts of the user's life. Depending on needs, the introduction extends 2-5 occasions and is paid.
- A checklist is followed during the introduction which is designed according to the user, where everything is and how everything works. As well as an overview of all tasks and routines.

## Our offer

The forms of employment we offer are: trial employment, fixed-term employment, temporary employment, paid by the hour or for as long as the assistance assignment lasts (which corresponds to permanent employment).

## Coordinator - a personal supervisor in the assistance

An important role in our team is our coordinators, who are a central part of our support system to ensure that you as a customer receive the best possible assistance.

Our coordinators are experienced and knowledgeable professionals who are responsible for coordinating and organizing the personal assistance for our customers.

One of the most important tasks for our coordinators is to ensure that you receive individually tailored assistance according to your needs and wishes. They work with you and your network to design a personalized assistance plan that is tailored to meet your unique requirements and wishes. This may include helping you recruit and train your assistants, planning and scheduling assistance appointments, and following up that the assistance is carried out in a professional manner.

They act as a link between you as a customer, your assistants and other actors involved in your assistance, such as authorities and other healthcare providers. The coordinators are experts in navigating the complex legislation and administrative processes surrounding personal assistance, making it easier for you as a customer to get the support you need.

Our coordinators are also your support when it comes to managing communication and collaboration with other actors. They can help you communicate with authorities, apply for compensation and assist with documentation and reporting. They also act as a point of contact for your assistants and can help resolve any challenges or conflicts that may arise in the assistance work.

We value the relationships and trust between our customers and the coordinators. Our coordinators are responsive to your needs and wishes and work to create a personal and professional relationship with you as a customer.
